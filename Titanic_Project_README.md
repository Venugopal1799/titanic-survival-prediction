# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning solution built to predict the survival of Titanic passengers using the famous Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).

---

## 📌 Project Objective

Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, passenger class, fare, and more.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Handling missing values and categorical variables
- Feature selection and encoding
- Logistic Regression & Random Forest Classifier
- Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Feature importance analysis

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- Files Used: `train.csv`

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle (`train.csv`)
2. Open the notebook (`.ipynb`) in Google Colab or Jupyter
3. Upload the dataset when prompted
4. Run all cells to clean data, train the model, and evaluate accuracy
